# Predicting-minimum-doubling-time-of-microbes-using-deep-learning-models
Growth rate is a fundamental microbial physiological trait, yet accurately estimating the minimum doubling time, particularly for slow-growing microbial communities, remains challenging for many in-house tools that rely on codon usage biases. Codon-based models have been widely applied in downstream predictions, including optimal growth temperature, melting point, and transcript abundance. In this study, we finetuned LookingGlass, a pretrained codon language model to enhance the prediction of microbial minimum doubling time. We will further evaluate whether incorporating additional features, such as growth temperature and gene expression signals, could improve prediction accuracy. Overall, LookingGlass model finetuned on ribosomal proteins showed improved performance among the slow growing microbes.
